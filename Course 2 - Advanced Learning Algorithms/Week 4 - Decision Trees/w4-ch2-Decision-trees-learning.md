Let's take the example of _Cat Classification_ problem.

-   First, let's define $p_1$ as _the fraction of examples that are positive (cat)_.
-   If we plot the **Entropy** graph, it will look like this:

<img src="./images/entropy-graph-1.jpg" alt="entropy graph" width="400px" style="padding:10px">

-   where:
-   -   On $x$-axis, we have the $p_1$.
-   -   On $y$-axis, we have $H(p_1)$, where $H()$ represents the **entropy** function.
-   So, the **Entropy** graph is a curve, which starts from $0$ and goes upto $1$ and then come back to $0$, based on different values of $p_1$.
-   If we plot different values of $p_1$ on $x$-axis, we get a value b/w $0.0$ and $1.0$ as a value of _Impurity_.
-   Let's say, we have $5$ features of _Cat_ and _Dog_ and has total $6$ examples, with the random no. of _cats_ and _dogs_. And we want to measure how _impure_ they are.

-   $1^{st}$ feature:
-   -   Fraction of _Cats_ $p_1 = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5$
-   -   _Impurity_ $H(p_1) = 1$, highly impure.

<img src="./images/3-cats.jpg" alt="3 cats" width="400px" style="padding:0 0 30px 50px">

-   $2^{nd}$ feature:
-   -   Fraction of _Cats_ $p_1 = \frac{0}{6} = 0$
-   -   _Impurity_ $H(p_1) = 0$, not at all impure.

<img src="./images/0-cats.jpg" alt="0 cats" width="400px" style="padding:0 0 30px 50px">

-   $3^{rd}$ feature:
-   -   Fraction of _Cats_ $p_1 = \frac{5}{6} = 0.83$
-   -   _Impurity_ $H(p_1) = 0.65$, little impure.

<img src="./images/5-cats.jpg" alt="5 cats" width="400px" style="padding:0 0 30px 50px">

-   $4^{th}$ feature:
-   -   Fraction of _Cats_ $p_1 = \frac{2}{6} = 0.33$
-   -   _Impurity_ $H(p_1) = 0.92$, very impure.

<img src="./images/2-cats.jpg" alt="2 cats" width="400px" style="padding:0 0 30px 50px">

-   $5^{th}$ feature:
-   -   Fraction of _Cats_ $p_1 = \frac{6}{6} = 1$
-   -   _Impurity_ $H(p_1) = 0$, not impure, or fully pure.

<img src="./images/6-cats.jpg" alt="6 cats" width="400px" style="padding:0 0 30px 50px">

-   Now, if we plot all the $H(p_1)$ values, we will a plot like this:

<img src="./images/entropy-graph-2.jpg" alt="entropy graph with h(p1) values" width="500px" style="padding: 10px 50px">

-   Here, $2$ values of $p_1$ i.e. $0$ and $1$ has _impurity_ of $0$, means, they are fully pure.
-   $p_1 = 0$ or $H(p_1) = 0$ represents that the subset have $0$ _Cats_.
-   $p_1 = 1$ or $H(p_1) = 0$ represents that the subset have all the _Cats_.
-   And, $p_1 = 0.5$ and $H(p_1) = 1$ represents the subset is $100\%$ _impure_, and hence have half _Cats_ and half _Dogs_.

And recall that we want to choose a feature which is highly _pure_, because based on that feature, our **Decision Tree** will start splitting the data.

---

#### Formula of Entropy function $H(S)$

We know that:

-   $p_1$ is the fraction of examples in a subset that belongs to a positive class (cats).
-   So, we can also say that, $p_0$ would be the fraction of examples in a subset that belongs to a negative class (Dogs).

$$p_0 = 1 - p_1$$

-   And, we calculate _Impurity_ of $p_1$ using **Entropy** function $H(p_1)$.
-   where $H(p_1)$ is:

$$H(p_1) = -p_1\log_2(p_1) -  p_0\log_2(p_0)$$

-   Here, we are calculating the log of each class ($p_1$ and $p_0$) with base $2$.
-   We can also write it as:

$$H(p_1) = -p_1\log_2(p_1) -  (1- p_1)\log_2(1 - p_1)$$

-   But, above is the simplified version of this.
-   **Note**: If $p_1$ or $p_0$ is $0$, then the expression $0\log(0) = 0$, would be zero.
-   It's actually undefined, $-\infty$, but we take it as $0$, for correclty computing the **Entropy**.
-   If we plot it with different values of $p$, we will have a plot like this, which we've seen above.

<img src="./images/entropy-graph-1.jpg" alt="entropy graph" width="400px" style="padding:10px 50px">

> So, When we build a **Decision Tree**, we need to choose a feature to split at a node, which has less _entropy_ (_impurity_) or **maximum purity**.

There are other functions that look like the same, like _Gini_ function, which starts from $0$, but goes upto $0.5$ and come back to $0$.

### Information Gain

Recall that, when building a **decision tree**, we need to choose a feature to split which _minimizes entropy_ or _maximizes the purity_.

> In **Decision Tree** learning, the reduction of _entropy_ is called _Information Gain_.

With the example of _Cat Classification_, let's see how to comptue _Information Gain_ and choose which feature to split on.

#### Ear Shape

-   Let's take the _Ear Shape_ feature first, and categorize examples based on their _Ear Shape_.

<img src="./images/cat-ear-shape.jpg" alt="ear shape" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   Here, if we calculate fraction of positive examples on both left and right branch, then we get $p_1 = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8$ on left branch and $p_1 = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2$ on right branch.
-   And entropy of left branch is $H(0.8) = 0.72$ and on right branch is $H(0.2) = 0.72$.

#### Face Shape

-   Now, let's take the _Face Shape_ feature and categorize examples based on their _Face shape_.

<img src="./images/cat-face-shape.jpg" alt="face shape" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   Here, if we calculate $p_1$ on both left and right branch, then we get $p_1 = \frac{4}{7} = 0.57$ and $p_1 = \frac{1}{3} = 0.33$ respectively.
-   And entropy of left branch is $H(0.57) = 0.99$ and on right branch is $H(0.33) = 0.92$.

#### Whiskers

-   Now, let's take the _Whiskers_ feature and categorize examples based on their _Whiskers_.

<img src="./images/cat-whiskers.jpg" alt="Whiskers" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   Here, if we calculate $p_1$ on both left and right branch, then we get $p_1 = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75$ and $p_1 = \frac{2}{6} = 0.33$ respectively.
-   And entropy of left branch is $H(0.75) = 0.81$ and on right branch is $H(0.33) = 0.92$.

#### Calculation of Information Gain

> Now, the question is which these different values of entropy of both branches of all features, how do we choose which feature to split on ?

-   Rather than just looking on numbers and comparing them with each other, we can take their weighted averages.
-   Because, if the $p_1$ is high then the entropy will be high too and even if the $p_1$ is low, then also entropy will be high, so taking weighted average would result better.
-   So, for each feature, we will multiply the total number of examples in each branch with it's entropy and then add them.
-   And, by the convention of making a **Decision Tree**, we will subtract the entropy of _root node_.
-   So, we have total $10$ examples, out of them $5$ are _Cats_ (positives). So, $p_1 = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$ and entropy will be $H(0.5) = 1$
-   **Ear Shape**:

$$H(0.5)- \left(\frac{5}{10}0.72 + \frac{5}{10}0.72\right) = 0.28$$

-   **Face Shape**:

$$H(0.5)- \left(\frac{7}{10}0.99 + \frac{3}{10}0.92\right) = 0.03$$

-   **Whiskers**:

$$H(0.5)- \left(\frac{4}{10}0.81 + \frac{6}{10}0.92\right) = 0.12$$

-   And all these $3$ resulted valeus are the _Information Gain_ of each feature split.
-   It measures the reduction in entropy by making a split.
-   Because the entropy was originally one at the root node and by making the split, you end up with a lower value of entropy and the difference between those two values is a reduction in entropy.
-   And, we will use that feature to split, which has the highest _Information Gain_.

#### Question: Why do we compute reduction in Entropy rather than just Entropy ?

> It turns out that one of the stopping criteria for deciding when to not bother to split any further is if the reduction in _entropy_ is too small.
>
> In which case you could decide, you're just increasing the size of the tree unnecessarily and risking **overfitting** by splitting and just decide to not bother if the reduction in _entropy_ is too small or below a threshold. ~ _Andrew Ng_

#### Formula of Information Gain

-   Let's first call the $p_1$ for each branch as $p_1^{left}$ for left branch and $p_1^{right}$ for right branch.
-   And, $w^{left}$ for the fraction of examples in left branch and $w^{right}$ for the fraction of examples in right branch.
-   Finally, $p_1$ of _root node_ as $p_1^{root}$.
-   And, our formula will be:

$$\text{Information Gain } = H(p_1^{root}) - \left(w^{left}p_1^{left} + w^{right}p_1^{right}\right)$$

> So, _Information gain_ is then defined as the _entropy_ of $p_1^{root}$, so what's the _entropy_ at the root node, minus that _weighted entropy_ calculation that we had on the previous slide, minus $w^{left}$ those were 5/10 in the example, times the _entropy_ applied to $p_1^{left}$, that's _entropy_ on the left sub-branch, plus $w^{right}$ the fraction of examples that went to the right branch, times _entropy_ of $p_1^{right}$. ~ _Andrew Ng_

-   With this definition of entropy, and you can calculate the information gain associated with choosing any particular feature
    to split on in the node.
-   Then out of all the possible futures, you could choose to split on, you can then pick the one that gives you the highest information gain.
-   That will result in, hopefully, increasing the purity of your subsets of data that you get on the left and right sub-branches
    of your **Decision tree** and that will result in choosing a feature to split on that increases the purity of your subsets of data in both the left and right sub-branches of your **Decision tree**.

### Steps Building a Decision Tree

-   So, we have learnt how to choose a feature to split and when to stop splitting more.
-   Now, let's see the overall steps of building a **Decision tree**.

1. Start with all examples at the _root node_.
2. Calculate _Information Gain_ for all possible features, and pick the one with the highest _Information Gain_.
3. Split dataset according to selected features adn create left and right branches of the tree.
4. Keep repeating splitting process until stopping criteria is met:

-   -   When a node is $100\%$ one class.
-   -   When splitting a node will result in exceeding the maximum depth.
-   -   _Information Gain_ from additional splits is less than the _threshold_.
-   -   When number of examples in a node is less than the _threshold_.

Now, let's see these steps with the _Cat Classification_ example:

1. First we need to choose a feature to split on _root node_ with highest _Information Gain_.

<img src="./images/root-node-0.jpg" alt="root node" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

2. Let's say, we get the highest _Information Gain_ on _Ear Shape_ for _root node_.

<img src="./images/root-node-1.jpg" alt="root node" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

3. Now, let's focus on left branch.
4. Say, after calculating _Information Gain_ on left branch examples, we got hgihest _Information Gain_ on _Face Shape_, so we split them on it.

<img src="./images/left-node-0.jpg" alt="left node" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

5. Now, we will check the stopping criteria, here left branch is $100\%$ one class, also right branch is also $100\%$ class.
6. So, we make them as _leaf nodes_.

<img src="./images/left-node-1.jpg" alt="left node" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

7. Now, let's focus on right branch of _root node_.
8. So, let's assume we got highest _Information Gain_ with _Whiskers_ feature, so we split right branch's examples on it.

<img src="./images/right-node-0.jpg" alt="right node" width="400px" style="padding:10px 50px">

9. Now, also we met stopping criteria, i.e. both branches has $100\%$ once class, so we stop there and make them as _leaf nodes_.
10. Finally, our **Decision Tree** is built.

<img src="./images/final-tree.jpg" alt="right node" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   If we notice it, it's like a \*_Recursive Algorithm_.

### One Hot Encoding

In _Cat Classification_ example, we have this data:

<img src="./images/cat-data.jpg" alt="cat data" width="1000px" style="padding:10px">

-   But, let's say, now rather than having $3$ values in _Ear Shape_, we will have $3$ values:
-   -   _Pointy_
-   -   _Floppy_
-   -   _Oval_

<img src="./images/oh-encoding.jpg" alt="cat new data" width="1000px" style="padding:10px">

-   So, now we'll have a node for _Ear Shape_ with $3$ values.
-   But we can transform this data, especially this feature so that in our tree we don't have any node with more than $2$ values.

-   We are going to use **One Hot Encoding**.

> In **One Hot Encoding**, we encode the column(s) in $1$ and $0$ format, if it has $2$ values or we make separate columns for all unique values in a column with $1$ indicating presence of that value and $0$ indicating absence of that value.

-   So, after doing **One Hot Encoding**, our dataset will be:

<img src="./images/oh-encoding-1.jpg" alt="cat one hot encoded data" width="1000px" style="padding:10px">

-   Having $1$ in _Pointy ears_ for those rows which has _Pointy_ as value in _Ear Shape_, and similarly for _Floppy_ and _Oval_.
-   Now, we can make **Decision Tree** on this dataset more easily.

---

-   But, still we can't use this dataset for **neural networks** or **logistic regression**.
-   For that, we need to transform other $2$ features too!
-   So, for _Face Shape_ and _Whiskers_ feature, we can also do **One Hot Encoding**, where:
-   -   replace _Round_ with $1$ and _Not round_ with $0$.
-   -   Similarly, _Present_ with $1$ and _Absent_ with $0$.

<img src="./images/oh-encoding-2.jpg" alt="cat fully one hot encoded data" width="1000px" style="padding:10px">

---

### Continuous Valued Features

Let's say now we have another column named _Weights_ on _Cat Classification_ example.

So, our dataset is like this:

<img src="./images/cat-weight-feature.jpg" alt="cat weight data" width="1000px" style="padding:10px">

-   Notice, the weight column is having continuous values.
-   Conversely, other features has discrete set of values.

Now, the question is - How we can split the _Weight_ feature ?

-   Let's plot the data on a _scatter plot_ where:
-   -   _weight_ is on $x$-axis
-   -   _Cat_ (target variable) is on $y$-axis

<img src="./images/cat-weight-graph-1.jpg" alt="weight graph" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   What we can do is,
-   We can make different _thresholds_ here, and split data on them and find _Information Gain_, and which one has highest, we'll choose that _threshold_ value.
-   First, let's say we choose $8$, so on $8$ we split our _weight_ feature based on whether the weight is greater or less than $8 lbs.$ on not and calculate _Information Gain_.

<img src="./images/cat-weight-graph-2.jpg" alt="weight 8 lbs graph" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   So, let's say the _Information Gain_ is $0.24$.

$$H(0.5) = \left(\frac{2}{10}H\left(\frac{2}{2}\right) + \frac{8}{10}H\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)\right) = 0.24$$

-   where:
    $$w^{left} = \frac{2}{10} \qquad w^{right} = \frac{8}{10}$$
    $$p_1^{left} = \frac{2}{2} \qquad p_2^{right} = \frac{3}{8}$$

-   Similarly, now let's take _threshold_ as $13$ and plot it and find _Information Gain_ with it.

<img src="./images/cat-weight-graph-3.jpg" alt="weight 13 lbs graph" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   Say, we got an _Information Gain_ of $0.40$

$$H(0.5) = \left(\frac{7}{10}H\left(\frac{5}{7}\right) + \frac{3}{10}H\left(\frac{0}{3}\right)\right) = 0.40$$

-   where:
    $$w^{left} = \frac{7}{10} \qquad w^{right} = \frac{3}{10}$$
    $$p_1^{left} = \frac{5}{7} \qquad p_2^{right} = \frac{0}{3}$$
-   This time, _Information Gain_ is higher than previous one.

-   let's now try with one more value of _threshold_ i.e. $9$ and plot it and find _Information Gain_ with it.

<img src="./images/cat-weight-graph-4.jpg" alt="weight 9 lbs graph" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   Say, we got an _Information Gain_ of $0.61$.

$$H(0.5) = \left(\frac{4}{10}H\left(\frac{4}{4}\right) + \frac{6}{10}H\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\right) = 0.40$$

-   where:
    $$w^{left} = \frac{4}{10} \qquad w^{right} = \frac{6}{10}$$
    $$p_1^{left} = \frac{4}{4} \qquad p_2^{right} = \frac{1}{6}$$
-   This time, _Information Gain_ is higher than both of the previous two.

So, we will split our _Weight_ feature based on this _threshold_ value i.e. $9 lbs$.

<img src="./images/cat-weight-tree.jpg" alt="cat weight tree" width="300px" padding="10px 50px">

Now, here we randomly choose $3$ different values of _threshold_ and find _Information Gain_ in each and used the best one.

But, in general way, we can't choose only $3$ values.

-   Rather, we sort the column values.
-   Then, take all the values of all the midpoints b/w that sorted list.
-   So, if we have $10$ training examples, then we use $9$ mid-points.
-   And find which one value has the highest _Information Gain_.
-   Finally, use that _threshold_ value to split our continuous valued feature.

---

### Regression Trees

So, till now we have discussed how to build a **Decision Tree** for _Classification_ problems.

But, now let's see how to build **Decision Trees** for _Regression_ problems

Say, we have this dataset:

<img src="./images/regression-cat.jpg" alt="regression-cat" width="1000px" style="padding:10px">

-   where we have $3$ input features:
-   -   _Ear Shape_
-   -   _Face Shape_
-   -   _Whiskers_
-   and a target variable _Weight_ $y$.

So, now we want to predict the weight of the animal withe the given _input_ features $\vec{x}$.

#### Predicting the Output

-   Say, we have build our **Decision Tree** like this:

<img src="./images/regression-decision-tree.jpg" alt="decision tree" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   And, on each _leaf_ node we have splitted the animals.
-   Now, let's say, we got a test data, where it has:
-   -   Pointy _Ear Shape_
-   -   Round _Face Shape_
-   So, in this decision tree, it will end up reaching the leftmost _leaf_ node.
-   There, we have $4$ animals with their weights $7.2, 8.4, 7.6, 10.2$.
-   We will compute the average of all the weights, which will be our prediction for the test data.
-   So, say, it's average is $8.35$, so this will our model's prediction.
-   Now, similarly, if we encounter different test-cases which end up on all different _leaf_ node.
-   Then, we will compute their average and output the average as the prediction of our model.

<img src="./images/regression-decision-tree-2.jpg" alt="decision tree" width="500px" style="padding:10px 50px">

-   Now, we don't know how we have splitted the features, like on basis of what ?
-   So, let's figure it out, how do we split our features in _Regression_ problems.

---

### Splitting Features

In _Classification_ problems, we find _Information Gain_, which is reduction in _Entropy_ and use that feature which has highest _Information Gain_.

Here, in _Regression_ problems, we'll do a little different.

-   Rather than calculating the _purity / Impurity_, we will compute the _variance_ in each split of each feature.

#### Variance

-   Variance describes how much our data varies.
-   It's formula is:

$$\text{Variance } = \frac{\sum\left(x^i - \mu\right)^2}{n}$$

-   where:
-   -   $\mu$ is the mean of the data
-   -   $x^i$ is $i^{th}$ value of all examples.
-   -   $n$ is no. of examples

#### Reduction in Variance

-   First, we will calculate variance in each feature split.
-   We will split the data into all $3$ input features.
-   Then, we will compute weighted average for each feature.
-   Finally, subtract it from the variance in _root node_ i.e. $20.51$.

#### _Ear Shape_

<img src="./images/regression-split-1.jpg" alt="ear shape split" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

|  Branch   | Weight                     | Variance |      $w$       |
| :-------: | :------------------------- | :------: | :------------: |
| **left**  | $7.2, 9.2, 8.4, 7.6, 10.2$ |  $1.47$  | $\frac{5}{10}$ |
| **right** | $8.8, 15, 11, 18, 20$      | $21.87$  | $\frac{5}{10}$ |

$$20.51 - \left(\frac{5}{10}1.47 + \frac{5}{10}21.87\right)$$

-   **Weighted Average**: $11.67$
-   **Reduction in Variance**: $8.84$

#### _Face Shape_

<img src="./images/regression-split-2.jpg" alt="face shape split" width="300px" style="padding:10px 50px">

|  Branch   | Weight                            | Variance |      $w$       |
| :-------: | :-------------------------------- | :------: | :------------: |
| **left**  | $7.2, 15, 8.4, 7.6, 10.2, 18, 20$ | $27.80$  | $\frac{7}{10}$ |
| **right** | $8.8, 9.2, 11$                    |  $1.37$  | $\frac{3}{10}$ |

$$20.51 - \left(\frac{7}{10}27.80 + \frac{3}{10}1.37\right)$$

-   **Weighted Average**: $19.87$
-   **Reduction in Variance**: $0.64$

$$20.51 - \left(\frac{4}{10}0.75 + \frac{6}{10}23.32\right)$$

-   **Weighted Average**: $14.29$
-   **Reduction in Variance**: $6.22$

#### Finalizing the Feature

-   Now that we have computed the _Reduction in Variance_ for each feature.
-   Similar to _Information Gain_, we will choose the feature which has highest _Reduction in Variance_.
-   And, do this process recursively, until we met the stopping criteria.
